## Hi,

The project is built using 

[-] Uses cucumber swift for writing tests
[ ] To add new tests we must update the .feature files
[ ] The tests auto run on every deploy to the main branch
[ ] Uses AWS Cognite via Amplify for login
[ ] Uses email+password to login
[ ] Has a simple view with weight login
[ ] The weight loggin view has a check mechanism that ensures only integer entries are logged as weights
